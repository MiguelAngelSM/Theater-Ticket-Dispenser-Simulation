# Technical features

- Implemented with AbsoluteLayout.jar, TheaterTicketDispenserSimulator.jar and UrjcBankServer.jar as the GUI given by the teachers.

- Oriented for *Spanish speakers*, *Basque speakers*, *Galician speakers*, *Catalan speakers* and *English speakers*.

# Explanation of the project
The Dispenser has two main operations (this amount can increase):
-Select Language: it lets the user change the language configuration of the Dispenser.
-Buy Tickets: it lets the user select the *date*, *area* and *seats* (maximum of 4) for the tickets. Then it ask for a credit card and it finally realizes the payment and prints the tickets.

On weekends the price is multiplied by a multiplier given in the config file for the theater.
